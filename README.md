# NodePop HTML GUI Experiment
This is my attempt to create a nice GUI in HTML using AHK scripting language.
Some features does not work, f.e. Settings window.
Feel free to try it!
It may work OK, but I would not reccomend to use this version.
The main release of NodePop! have all working handy features.


# ROADMAP
- on double click on result - spawn that node
- create HTML GUI for settings
- FixIE(): check if registry key has already a proper value to avoid changing it
- slider for adapting script speed
- remove "WM_KEYDOWN" when not needed at the very end

* add bolding of text to results based on inputed text
* ability to bind as many hotkeys as needed for any node popping
* add animations in CSS for showing, hiding and scrolling results
* add a hidden button in right upper corder of popup tool GUI to switch to a 'next page'
* split HTML code to a different file
* implement classes
