# HOW TO USE
To run this you will need to install AHK (AutoHotKey) scripting environment: https://www.autohotkey.com/

Just install AHK and run the script by clicking on .ahk file like if it were an .exe file.
If you are interested you can see what is inside the script - just open it with your favourite text editor.

# USAGE
Just hit Ctrl+Space, write the name of a node (or use even simple phrases), hit Enter and Pop!

# FREQUENCY
Each time you spawn a node, it's usage frequency goes up.
Your most frequent nodes will appear in the search result list when no letter is typed inside search field.

# QUICKSLOTS
I've also implemented FIVE QUICK SLOTS for binding any node to any key combination.
Just bind your most favorite nodes and spawn them instantly.

# TYPO-PROOF
I implemented spelling-correction fix!
Now you can make a couple of typos or even type something bizarre in search window and it will still print some really good results!

# SUMMARY
I stopped intending to close this script in an executable form any more.
I rather keep it opensource.
Feel free to modify this script for your needs.
Maybe you can expand it's functionality?

Just have fun with it!
